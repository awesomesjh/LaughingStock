NUS Orbital 2023

Hey there we are team Laughing Stock! =)

Level of achievement: Gemini

Scope: We plan to create a website that displays one's current stock portfolio for easier checking and to gain experience in both web development and the creation of a telegram bot that can push notifications.

Motivation: 
1. Checking my stock portfolio using a trading app takes a lot of time in part due to 2FA, which can be very tedious and annoying especially if I just want to take a quick glance at my portfolio. Through this web application, I want to be able to easily check my stock portfolio with simple analysis tools. 

2. To gain experience with React, Express, PostgreSQL and the telegram API.

Our core features:
1. User login functionality
Allow users to create an account and log in
Allow users to change their password

2. Functionality to customize stock portfolio
Allows users to add and remove stocks to their portfolio

3. Candlestick chart
To view change in price of certain stock

4. Pie chart
To view composition of portfolio

5. Line graph
To view change in portfolio value over time

6. Links to relevant news articles
To gain information on certain stocks

7. Telegram bot
To push notifications predefined by the user

User Stories:
1. As a user, I would want to be able to easily access the website and get a quick overview of my portfolio.
2. As a user, I want to be able to look at relevant charts and gain an insight on how my portfolio is doing.
3. As a user, I would want to receive notifications if there is a significant change to the value of my portfolio.

Current Progress:
Features: Currently, one can create an account and login in with it. Add, remove and edit a stock. 
Problems: One must create their own fly.io database for the code to use. Edge cases have not been thoroughly tested. All stocks are currently set to be $120. Database is not fully linked to the rendering of the table.
